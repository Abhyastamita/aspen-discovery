- When a patron does not have a valid hoopla account, the response from the APIs contains an invalid response.  We suggest translating that message to send the user to your default hoopla url.  
- If you use LibCal create an API key and setup the integration. 
- If you have LibCal and use Combined Results, add LibCal to the list of items shown in Combined Results.
- If you have LibCal and want to show a link to the calendar, add a menu link to /Events/Calendar.
- Koha Libraries review what sections of the user profile you want to be read only and update settings appropriately within Library settings.
- If you use Syndetics Unbound, default covers can be cleared so fresh covers can be fetched.  Submit a ticket if you have a lot, or they can be reloaded from staff view.
