- Axis 360 and cloudLibrary items are available to place holds on and check out
- Side loaded content is available in the app
- Added framework for localizing the text that is hardcoded into the app
- Updated when and what alert dialogs, banners, and toasts are used to provide information on an action (i.e. place hold) or app process (i.e. server connection failed)
- Updated app icons and logos for LiDA branding
- To prevent issues with data loading in the background, the login screen will now simply ask a user to select their library and then display the username/password inputs after a library has been selected
- The library favicon now displays next to the library in the "Select Your Library" modal
- Renamed "Find Nearby Libraries" button on the Login screen to "Reset Geolocation" to clarify the purpose

- All the formats for a grouped work are now displayed on the screen instead of being in a modal
- Language variations in a grouped work are now displayed
- Placing a hold or checkout out an item now works as a matching system. The user must select a format and a language (the first option of each is always selected by default) and will then be given a list of items from the grouped work that match the selections. If no match is found, it will simply display an unavailable combination message with the values selected.
- Using the "Access Online" button with side loaded content opens the resource to give the user immediate access
- If at least 1 user rating exists, the average user rating will be displayed

- Item actions have been moved and are now accessed by tapping on the item
- Users can force reload of checkouts or holds by pulling down on the list of items (the loading spinner will display)
- eContent can now be opened and accessed within the app (OverDrive, Axis 360 and cloudLibrary)
- Format badges in search results will now properly wrap instead of going offscreen
- The "Email a Librarian" button on Contact screen will now look for the contactEmail from the location/branch with a backup of the library setting. If neither is provided, the button will not populate
- Added "Get Directions" button on Contact screen that will open up the user's preferred Map app and provide directions to the location/branch. This is based off the geolocation coordinates provided by the address in Aspen settings. If the user has opted to share their geolocation data, it will use this to determine the starting location.
- Today's Hours will check the showInLocationsAndHoursList setting to determine if it should display or not
- "Visit Our Website" button will try to get a valid URL before displaying from either the Location or Library
- Added access to LiDA's privacy policy in the "More" menu
