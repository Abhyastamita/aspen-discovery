#Aspen Discovery 21.03.02 release notes
## CARL.X Updates
- Replace all items on a bib with a fresh copy from the CARL.X APIs when we detect changes to the bib record.
- Add a one minute buffer when checking for records that have changed to account for differences between servers.  
- Updates to ensure that all deleted bibs are properly removed from the index.
