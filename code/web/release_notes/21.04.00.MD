#Aspen Discovery 21.04.00 release notes
## Account Improvements
- Add caching of checkouts, holds, and account summaries.  Information is stored for 15 minutes by default, but can be reloaded by the patron.  The time the information was last loaded is shown in the upper right of the page and can be refreshed by selecting the refresh button.  This greatly improves the speed of viewing checkouts and holds when patrons have lots of things checked out or on hold or when they have several linked users. (Ticket 74294)
