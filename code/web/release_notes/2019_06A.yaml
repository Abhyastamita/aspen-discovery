Released
  - June 1, 2019
Major new functionality

- Created new default covers when covers cannot be found via Syndetics or other sources
- Library logos and favicons can be uploaded by administrators
Major revisions to existing functionality
- Updated OverDrive and Koha indexing to be 100% near real time with complete updates
- Updated Record Grouping Display to show different eContent sources (OverDrive and Rbdigital separately) and show languages differently within Grouped Works
- Updated Recommended For You to give better suggestions and dramatically improve performance so recommended for you can be used on the home page
- Search suggestions and spelling suggestions are dramatically better
- Non Keyword search results that do not return results provide the option to see how many results are available if a Keyword search is done and to easily perform a Keyword search.
- All exports run in parallel to avoid cases where one record source that has lots of changes slows down the overall index.  For example, OverDrive updates all titles on Wednesday and Sunday which caused a large delay in status updates for non OverDrive titles.
- User Lists can now be shown in the Explore More bar for increased exposure
- Libraries within the same consortium can have completely different urls (i.e. catalog.uintahlibrary.org and catalog.duchesnelibraries.org) which allows better branding for individual libraries.
