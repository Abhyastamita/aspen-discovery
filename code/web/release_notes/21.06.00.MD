#Aspen Discovery 21.06.00 release notes
## Account Updates
- Allow libraries to define specific formats as needing to be picked up from the owning library.  This is useful for collections like Seed Libraries, Wi-Fi Hotspots, and other collections where you do not want the materials to be transited via a courier. The option can be selected in the Format Section of an Indexing Profile.  After selection, the text on the hold popup changes slightly to indicate that the title must be picked up at the owning library. (Ticket 79833) 

## Polaris Updates

## Search Updates

- Fix so that searching both a format and top availability buttons will return the correct results. (Ticket 80753)

## Symphony Updates
