### Browse Category Updates
- Added a new permission to allow staff to be assigned to edit specific Browse Category Groups. When this permission is assigned, 
staff will be able to edit the groups they are assigned to and will have access to add Browse Categories that are shared with 
their library. When creating new browse categories, staff will be able to update categories that are active in the group they
are assigned to, and will only be able to add the new category as a subcategory of an active category in their group(s). If 
add to homepage is selected during creation, the category will be added to the first group the staff user has access to. (Ticket 87435)
