#Aspen Discovery 20.10.00 release notes
#Account Integration Updates
- Updates to allow long passwords up to 60 characters
- Check Historic Location Code when changing hold location within account interface for backwards compatibility

#Indexing Updates
- Allow records to be excluded from records owned or records to include for both libraries and locations based on the location code and/or the sub location code.
  In the example below, all files with a location of ABC, but not a sub location of DEF will be recorded as being owned by the library.
  Any records with a location of ABC and a sublocation of DEF will be included in library search results.
  Any records with a location not equal to XYZ will also be included in library search results.
  All exclusion fields can use regular expressions for matching.

- Added a new setting to library settings that controls which values Aspen shows within the Library System and Branch facets. 
  Administrators can change the setting by visiting [Library Systems](/Admin/Libraries) > Searching > Search Facets.  
  The setting defaults to on.  If it is turned off, all libraries and branches show in the facets.

- When indexing records check the format table to see if the format should be non holdable and if so mark the entire record as non holdable which causes the Place Hold button to not show.

#Koha Integration Updates
- When updating contact information mark fields that are both required and not needed as hidden fields. 
- Automatically load existing reading history from Koha when a user opts in to recording Reading History in Aspen.
- Automatically copy covers that have been uploaded to Koha. Aspen will use the covers that were uploaded in Koha for the display of records in Aspen.

#NoveList Integration Updates
- Add covers to the Similar Titles from Novelist section

#Placard Updates
- Add the ability to determine if a particular trigger word must be an exact match of the search term or if the word can match a portion of the search term.  Matching a portion of the search term is the new default.  In the example below, a search for "online legal help" would display the placard, but a search for "wills and trusts" would not.
