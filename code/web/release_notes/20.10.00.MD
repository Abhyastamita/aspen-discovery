#Placard Updates
- Add the ability to determine if a particular trigger word must be an exact match of the search term or if the word can match a portion of the search term.  Matching a portion of the search term is the new default.  In the example below, a search for "online legal help" would display the placard, but a search for "wills and trusts" would not.
