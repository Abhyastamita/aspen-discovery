## Aspen LiDA Updates
- In the background, we will periodically check if the Aspen Discovery session is still valid, and renew it if not.
- In the Account Drawer, users will now see 'Fines' as an option, which will open up the Fines page in Aspen Discovery.
- Added passUserToDiscovery to allow the app to open Aspen Discovery inside the app while pre-logging in the user based on the active app session.
