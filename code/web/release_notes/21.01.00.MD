- When placing a hold on a title, check to see if all items have an associated volume, and if not give the patron the option to pace a title level hold rather than a volume level hold.

- Don't show web notes from Sierra since there is not a consistent place to display it from.

## Collection Spotlight Updates
- Properly set the source for a collection spotlight when creating it from a list.  

## Permissions updates
- Update loading the lists of libraries and locations available based on new more refined permissions. 
- When showing System Messages, do not show an error message when no System Messages exist if the user can only administer System Messages for their library. 

## Symphony Integration Updates
- When updating contact information, send the entire original contact information to be sure that Symphony does not clear unchanged fields.   
- Automatically disable running full update after a full index completes to prevent slowing down Aspen indexing. 

## Web Builder Updates 
- Add an option to have links to resources defined by the library open within a new tab. 
- When login is not required for a custom form, display a captcha for the form. 
- If a library has indicated that login should be required when submitting a form, display the login form prior to showing the custom form. 
- Ensure that libraries saved for custom forms redisplay properly.

## Additional changes and bug fixes
- In the monitoring script, add a check if an indexing script has been running more than 8 hours and change the cron check to a warning. 
- For long library card numbers, ensure that the barcode displayed does not extend past the edge of the browser. 
- Do not show error messages when deleting System Messages, Placards, and JavaScript Snippets.
- If there is an error loading the place hold form, make sure to display that message to the patron.
- When a user stops storing reading history, make sure to not reload it from the ILS if they resume tracking reading history.
