#Aspen Discovery 20.13.00 release notes
## Indexing Updates 
- Add a new option to the Indexing Profile to control how Aspen builds the detailed location.  If turned off, Aspen will not include the location in the detailed location. This is only recommended for libraries that have a single branch and are not part of a consortium.

## Koha integration updates
- Automatically detect if a user has opted into reading history within Koha the first time Aspen loads them from the database.  

## System reporting updates
- Add a new report to track usage of Aspen by IP Address. The report will show total number of requests, blocked requests, blocked API requests, and the date of the last request.
