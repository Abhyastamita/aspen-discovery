##IP Addresses

- Within Account -> Primary Configuration -> Underneath Library Systems you can define IP addresses for your library and/or library branches

- It is a great idea to define these IP addresses because it allows your Aspen Discovery layer to know when a patron is searching from within the library. To define an IP address, choose the 'Add New' button and input the address, Display Name of the branch, and from the Location dropdown choose which branch the IP address is assigned to. 

- When Aspen sees a patron is searching from a defined branch IP address the language of the catalog will change for items that live at the branch where they are searching. For example, you may see things change from available at Main Library to available here!
