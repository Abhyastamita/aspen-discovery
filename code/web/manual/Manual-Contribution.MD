## Contributing to the Aspen Discovery Help Manual

As part of the Aspen discovery community, you are welcome to contribute to the development of Aspen. One useful way to add contributions is by adding new information to the help manual through GitHub.

To add to the help manual, you will need to have a GitHub account, then create a new branch from mdnoble73 / aspen-discovery.

From your own branch, go to aspen-discovery / code / web / manual to make commits. Once a new commit has been created, you will then need to create a pull request from your branch to the most recent version of Aspen in mdnoble / aspen-discovery.
