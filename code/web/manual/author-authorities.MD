## Author Authorities

When authors go by more than one name or their name has different spellings or nicknames, the name variations can prevent titles from grouping in Aspen. The Author Authority setting allows you to choose a name variation as the authority and provide multiple variants to help Aspen recognize which titles should group together. Please note that this setting does not change anything in the display of search results or records in Aspen.

You will find Author Authorities under Catalog/Grouped Works in Aspen Discovery Administration.




To add an authority, click "Add New."

Next you’ll add the authority and click Save Changes and Return. You do not need to add anything to Normalized Value or Date Added, those will be completed automatically upon saving.

Notice that the Date Added and Normalized Value fields usually now have data. These are created during a background indexing process, so if they’re not there, they will be generated in 5-10 mintues. 

To add a name variant, click Add New and enter an Alternative Name. You can leave the Normalized Value field blank, it will be automatically generated after you save and the authority is indexed. You can now click Add New to add as many name variants as you need, and when you are done click Save Changes and Return.
