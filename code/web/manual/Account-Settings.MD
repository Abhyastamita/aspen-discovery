## Account Settings

Account setting is a highly customizable section of the patron account and therefore varies widely between libraries. Here, patrons are able to access their library card number and/or a scannable barcode, view or edit their contact information and messaging settings, view and edit preferences including the preferred language for the catalog, manage linked accounts, and view and edit Overdrive and Hoopla options. Many libraries choose to have patrons contact them to change their contact information, and so this may not be available through your library's Aspen Discovery.
