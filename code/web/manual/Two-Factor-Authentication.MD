##Two-Factor Authentication

This is where you can set up and enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) profiles. You can create different profiles and apply them to selected Library Systems and/or selected Patron Types.

When editing a particular profile, you can give it a name to distinguish it from other profiles - eg 'Main Staff 2FA' for the Staff Patron Type at the Main Library.

You can choose whether 2FA is enabled:
-  No
-  Yes, but optional
-  Yes, and mandatory

Be careful not to set up mandatory 2FA until email settings are configured for your Aspen System.

The Denied Access Message can be used for giving instructions to users about recovering their account if they fail the 2FA process. There is a button at the top of the screen 'Recover User Account'. Use this to generate a one-time use code for a specific user if they request account recovery.
