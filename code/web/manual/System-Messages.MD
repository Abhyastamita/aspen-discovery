##System Messages

The System Messages area is where you can add timed and dated system messages by Library System and/or Library Location. These appear at the top of every page in the relevant System or Location and are in addition to system messages which can be configured under [Library System settings](/Admin/HelpManual?page=Library-Systems).

You can add new system messages or edit/delete existing ones. You can also select two existing messages and compare them, as well as select multiple or all to do batch updates.

When adding a new message, first give it a title for display in the administration settings. Then use the markdown text editor box to add your message. You can use markdown links for example to promote a particular set of search results. For example 'Spring titles' linking to a search for titles relating to Spring.

The Show On selector determines whether the message shows on All pages or a subset of pages (All Account, Checkout, Holds, Fine).

The Message Style selector applies default styling from a choice of several, or leaves the message unstyled.

Under Start and End Date to Show you can create a date/time controlled window for this message to be displayed. This means that you can configue multiple messages ahead of time and schedule them to appear and disappear automatically.

Under Libraries you can configure which Library Systems this particular message should appear on.

Under Locations you can configure which Library Locations this particular message should appear on.
