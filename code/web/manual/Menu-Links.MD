# Menu Links

## Creating Menu Links

You add these links into your catalog by navigating to Aspen Administration -> Primary Configuration -> Library Systems. Click into the library system setting you’d like to create menu links for and scroll down to the Menu Links section. Clicking “Add New” will populate empty link fields where your link information will go.

## Single Link or Nested Links?

To create a single menu link, give the link a name in the “Category” field. You’ll use this same name in the “Link Text” field. To include an icon next to your link, visit the [FontAwesome URL](https://fontawesome.com/v5/cheatsheet/free/solid) and paste the icon name in that column. Then specify a URL for your link. 

*Tip: if you’re linking to a page created with Web Builder, you can simply use the URL alias (“/help”).*

To create a set of nested links, you’ll first decide the name of the menu Category. This is the text that will become the header of your menu. You’ll create one link entry for each link in your menu. In this example, the Category is “Education,” and the Link Text fields contain “Articles,” “Videos,” and “Admin videos.”

## Top Menu or Hamburger Menu?

![Top Menu](topmenu.png)

Within the Menu Links section, use the scroll bar to see additional options for your links. Checking “Show In Top Menu” will put the link in the top menu. Leaving it unchecked will send the link to the hamburger menu.

*Note: when creating a nested link category for the top menu, be sure to check “Show in Top Menu” for all of the links nested within that category. Leave these boxes unchecked if you wish to create a nested link category for the hamburger menu.*

When “Always Show Icon in Top Menu” is checked, this means that the icon will remain in the top menu even if the window size changes (ie, for mobile view). As you can see, Uintah has specified that only certain icons remain visible in their top menu so that the most essential links are still available. The other top menu links don’t completely disappear when in this minimized view -- if the “Always Show” option isn’t checked, they will pop over to the hamburger menu.

Menu links are shown in the top menu if the screen is wider than 992px or if the Show In Top Menu (large screens only) option is selected. 
If this option is deselected or the screen is smaller than 992px wide, the menu will show in the hamburger menu.
With the Show Icon In Top Menu (all screen sizes) option turned on, the icon for the menu will show at all screen sizes and the menu will not be included in the hamburge menu. This option requires an icon to be selected.  If no icon is selected, the menu will be shown in the hamburger menu if the screen is smaller than 992px wide.

## Menu Links for Specific Patron Types

One of the exciting new features you can use with menu links, is the ability to pick and choose who can see the menu links and their information. In the settings of 'Menu Links', there is one setting that says ‘Show to logged in users only’.  

![Logged in Users](showtologgedinusers.png)

This setting will not only allow you to make that information only available to logged in users but it also allows you to decide which patron type is allowed to view that content. This means you could potentially have information you specify only Staff can see! In order to specify which users are allowed to view the menu link you are limiting you have to click the ‘Edit’ button on the right hand side of that 'Menu Links’ settings.

Once you click into those settings, Aspen will bring you into a setting page specifically for that link. A lot of the settings on that page are just the settings you have set in the library system, however at the bottom, once you have specified ‘Show to logged in users only’ Aspen will provide you with a list of all of your patron types. This is where you pick and choose who is able to see the link. If you want all logged in users to have access to the information, just click ‘Select All’ and then anyone once logged in can view.

## Menu Links for Specific Catalog Languages

As more and more of our partners are building out the languages their catalogs are translating into, we realize there is information that is only appropriate for specific versions of a translated catalog.

You can now build out different menu links for your different languages! Just like before when specifying what patron type can view a link, you will want to click ‘Edit’ on your menu link to go into the settings specific to that link. Once in that page, you will be able to set the languages that the menu link should display for. So if you wanted to make sure my policy information page is displaying as Spanish in the Spanish translated catalog, I can create one policy link which directs to your policy in English and another in Spanish and set the English link to display when the catalog is displaying in English and the Spanish link to display with patrons choose to switch into the Spanish translated version.
