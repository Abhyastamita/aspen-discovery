## Menu Links

Menu links can be added to the top of the page next to the home button or in the drop down menu on the top right of the page in the Library System link in Primary Configuration in the administration menu.

Menu links are shown in the top menu if the screen is wider than 992px or if the **Show In Top Menu (large screens only)** option is selected. 
If this option is deselected or the screen is smaller than 992px wide, the menu will show in the hamburger menu.
With the **Show Icon In Top Menu (all screen sizes)** option turned on, the icon for the menu will show at all screen sizes and the menu will not be included in the hamburge menu.
This option requires an icon to be selected.  If no icon is selected, the menu will be shown in the hamburger menu if the screen is smaller than 992px wide.
