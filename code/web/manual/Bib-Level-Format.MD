##Assigning Format Based on Biblio Record Data 

Within Aspen you have the capability to assign format based on bibliographic record data, instead of item specific codes (ie item types). In order to do this, within ILS Indexing Information under Format Information you assign 'Load Format From' to 'Bib Record'. Aspen Discovery thoroughly examines the biblio record and checks in various places before deciding what the format of the item is. The final format decision is based on the following criteria:


  * If the 008 is six characters or longer and the 6th character is a J, the format is 'MusicRecording'.
