## Materials Requests & Purchase Suggestions

Materials Requests can be enabled in the Library System settings under the Materials Request section. You can choose between the Aspen request system, an ILS request system, an external request link, or no system. Being able to specify material request settings at the system level means that each scoped library can choose whether or not to enable purchase requests for their library, and how to manage their own workflow. 

**ILS Request System**

Currently, this setting only works with the Koha ILS due to their built-in purchase request management functionality. If you use the Koha purchase suggestion module already, Aspen will pull in the required fields as specified in your system preferences and display the form within Aspen. To learn more about setting up or modifying purchase suggestions in Koha, check out[this blog post](https://bywatersolutions.com/news/purchase-suggestions-opac).

You can add an optional message to the form displayed in Aspen in the “New Request Summary” text editor. This will display above the form fields and can be used to inform your patrons of any restrictions or other helpful information.

**External Request Link**

Perhaps you use an external link or another online form for purchase suggestions. You might also have a variety of options available and would like to link patrons to either your library’s website or to a web builder page within Aspen to provide information to your patrons. In this case, setting up an external request link might work best for you.

Simply choose the External Request Link option, make sure “Turn on Materials Request for Public” is checked, and enter in the desired URL.

Submitting Material Requests

If you have any of the purchase suggestion options enabled, patrons can always find a link to submit requests at the bottom of search results. This will either take them to a form to complete, or to the external link you’ve specified in the settings.

When filling out a form, you can specify which fields are required in order to submit the form - other fields will be optional. Mandatory fields will be marked with a Required label.

After filling out the form and submitting with at least all the required fields, patrons will see a success screen confirming their submitted request, along with how many requests they’ve used or have in progress (if applicable).

If either the Aspen or ILS request options are enabled, patrons will also be able to access a link to submit requests from within their account, as well as view and manage their requests. Patrons can click their username, then click Materials Requests to see this information. They’ll be able to filter whether they see only open requests or all requests, check on the status of their requests, and cancel a request if the item is no longer needed. Clicking the “Details” button will show them all the information they supplied when filling out the form. They will not be able to edit this information, but they can cancel and resubmit if there are errors.
