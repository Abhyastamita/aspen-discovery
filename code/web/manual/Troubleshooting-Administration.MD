## Administration Troubleshooting
**Problem:**  
The library uses Koha and the hours for one or more days of a location keeps reverting to closed even after marking it as open. 

**Solution:**  
The library has a recurring holiday in Koha that indicates that it should be closed on that day. Deleting the holiday will allow you to mark the library as opened in Aspen.
