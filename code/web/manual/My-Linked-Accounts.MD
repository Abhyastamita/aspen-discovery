## Linked Accounts

This page is part of the [My Account](/MyAccount) area and depends on Account Linking being enabled in the [Library Systems](/Admin/HelpManual?page=Library-Systems) configuration under ILS/Account Integration.

It shows the patron any currently linked accounts and allows them to add other linked accounts. They need the account login credentials of any account they want to link to.
