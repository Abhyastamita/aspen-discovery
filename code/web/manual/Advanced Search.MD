## Advanced Search
- Advanced Search (notes derived from VuFind)
  - The advanced search page allows you to enter multiple terms in given fields. Options are available to select from a dropdown to narrow by (Keyword, Title, Start of Title, Author, Subject, ISBN/ISSN/UPC, Publisher, Series, Year of Publication, TOC, Record Number, Call Number). You can integrate the following Search Operators.
   - Operators
    - Phrase Searches - wrap the entire search in ("") phrase quotes. Placing double quotes at the beginning and end of your set of words will bring back results in the exact order without any change.   
    - Wildcard Searches - single character wildcard search uses the (?) 
      - Example: educat?
      - To perform a multiple character, 0 or more, wildcard search use the * symbol.      
      - Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.
    - Range Searches - this integrates the use of {} characters. Searching a range of letters or numbers. 
      - Example: {2009-20019} 
    - Boosting a Term - Boolean operators allow terms to be combined with logic operators. The following operators are      allowed: AND, +, OR, NOT and -.
      - Note: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS
     - The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching.
     - The AND operator matches records where both terms exist anywhere in the field of a record.
     - The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol exist somewhere in the field of a record.
     - The NOT operator excludes records that contain the term after NOT.
     - The - or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the "-" symbol.
   Match Terms - if you are using multiple search fields, you can specify how these terms will be returned 
    - ALL Terms - Return only records that match every search field.
    - ANY Terms - Return any records that match at least one search field.
    - NO Terms - Return all records EXCEPT those that match search fields.
 - The "Add Search Field" button may be used to add additional search fields to the form. You may use as many search fields as you wish.
 - Search Groups - allow you to build searches from multiple groups of search fields. When you click the "Add Search Group" button, a new group of fields is added.
