- You can define the language your patrons see under display name. This defines what the facet is called in the searches.
- 'Show above results' defines if that facet lives above the results or on the left-hand side of the results. Typically, format category and availability are good facets to display above the results. 
- If you choose the 'Multi Select?' box next to a facet, then a patron can choose two or more options within a facet. For example, if you have a subjects facet that allows multi select and patron could choose the 'Western' subject and the 'Horses' subject and find results for either. If you do not allow multi select and the patron still chose both 'Western' and 'Horses' underneath the subject facet they would only receive records that fulfilled both of those. 
- The 'can lock' option allows patrons to lock in their preferences for a facet so that choice is automatically chosen on future searches. 
- 'Collapse by default' when enabled forces the facets to initially displayed as collapsed.
- 'User More Facet Popup' allows a popup to generate when a patron clicks 'more' to see all the options for that facet. 
- In order to define which branches receive your grouped work facets settings, make sure your Grouped Work Display Settings' Facet Group is set to the proper Grouped Work Facets.
