## Browse Categories

- Browse Categories are a great way to display materials that your patrons are interested in or to highlight collections you would like to promote on your home landing page. You can create browse categories through search results and by curated lists. Additionally, you can create a list of lists and add those to a browse category.
- When you create a browse category, you can also add sub-browse categories to further define searches.

### Creating a Browse Category from a Catalog Search

1. Perform your search, limiting results with any desired facets. For example, if you want to feature new adult non-fiction titles in your collection, you could perform a blank search and select *Non-Fiction*, *Adult*, and *Added in the Last* to narrow your results.

3. Click **Update Category**. Your browse category will now display with your changes.

### :new: Adding Start and End Dates

If you want a browse category to only display temporarily -- for example, holidays or current events -- you can specify a start and end date for your browse category. Your browse category will only be visible from the main landing page during the date range specified.

![Add Start and End Dates](/manual/images/BrowseCategory_Start-End-Dates.jpg)

Start/end dates can be added by editing an existing browse category.

**Note:** If you no longer want a browse category after its end date, you can delete the category from Aspen Administration -> Local Catalog Enrichment -> Browse Categories.
