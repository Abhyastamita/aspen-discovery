## Axis 360

The Axis 360 module will need to first be enabled through the System Asministration Modules. Once the module has been enabled, you are able to enter your credentials through the Axis 360 module. In the module you are able to customize the scope, which will need to be specified through Library Systems.

### Dashboard
These report are only reporting on successful button clicks in Aspen. It's useful for seeing what percentage of your usage is happening in Aspen but for full usage statistics you should use your econtent vendor's dashboards within their platforms.
- **Active Users:**	Users within Aspen that have had successful check out or placed a successful hold
- **Records With Usage:**	Records with usage is total number of unique titles that have been checked out or placed on hold. So that number should be less than the number of holds and loans combined.
- **Loans:**	All successful checkouts in Aspen
- **Failed Loans:**	All unsuccessful holds or check outs
- **Renewals:**	Number of successful renewals in Aspen. Because a renewal is essentially a hold, some of those (the holds that were fulfilled and accessed via Aspen) are included in all time loans.
- **Early Returns:**	Number of early returns within Aspen
- **Holds:**	Number of successful holds places within Aspen
- **Failed Holds:**	Number of holds failed within Aspen
- **Cancelled Holds:**	Number of holds cancelled within Aspen
- **Holds Frozen:**	Number of holds put into a frozen status in Aspen
- **Holds Thawed:**	Number of holds removed from a frozen status /thawed in Aspen
- **Downloads:**	Downloads is the number of times the download button was clicked. So if you have a user that is using Aspen to access the read online version, there would be one click for each time they opened the book OR if a user downloaded a title on one device but then needed it downloaded on another, that would result in 2 downloads for the same title.
- **Previews:**	Number of previews accessed in Aspen
- **Options Updates:**	Updating their preferences in Axis360 in Aspen Your Account
- **API Errors:**	Anytime we get an error back when accessing a record; we go to place a hold a hold or check out and we receive an error; if you're noticing a lot of them, let us know; we're not automatically monitoring these
- **Connection Failures:** 	Axis360s entire APIs are down; should be zero for everyone
