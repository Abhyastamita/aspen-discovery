## End User Troubleshooting
**Problem:**  
For patrons using Chrome, when trying to access a PDF using the Access Online button, the patron is not directed to the PDF.  

**Solution:**  
In Chrome settings, there is an option to *Download PDF files instead of automatically opening them in Chrome*. If this option is turned on, the Access Online button will appear to not work because the file is being downloaded.
