Your child now has access to a robust selection of reading material anytime, anywhere  with Limitless Libraries’ new Level Up learning platform. Level Up gamifies reading practice which will help your child find books on their reading level, sharpen their reading and writing skills, and motivate them to practice reading  outside of school.

Here are some other easy ways to help your child practice new skills and promote a culture of literacy at home:

    Ask questions that allow children to predict what might happen next
    When you or your child is reading out loud, pause to ask your child to think about what was just read and make a logical prediction about what might happen next.
    Help them look for interesting new words
    Use mail, magazines, food packaging, etc. to find new words and then use context clues to help your child determine the meaning.
    Rhyme words
    Use the name of your child, objects, or places to rhyme real or nonsense words. There is no wrong way to play this game and it will strengthen their understanding of sounds and letters.
    Find words that start with the same sounds
    When your child is learning sounds at school, take the opportunity to reinforce that learning by helping them find words at home that begin with the same sound.
    Relate what is happening in the story to the child’s own life experiences
    No one knows more about your child and what they’ve experienced than you do - use those to connect real-life experiences to what happens to the characters in stories that you are sharing. This gives an important application of ideas and helps to build reading comprehension skills.
