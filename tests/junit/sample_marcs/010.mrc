Themed after the classic novel Journey to the West, this party game has up to four players competing to come out on top. While Tang priest Xuanzang has collected the scriptures Buddha asked him to seek out, when the rabbids appear they accidentally scatter the texts again and the journey has to start all over. Luckily, the rabbids are willing to go seek them out. The large number of minigames has players doing anything from riding rockets to speed eating hot chilies, and players have to master their very different gameplay to beat their friends. Aside from the traditional multiplayer mode, an adventure mode lets players follow the game's story."--Mobygames.com 0aPlumbersvComputer games. 0aRabbids (Fictitious characters)vComputer games. 0aBrothersvComputer games. 0aImaginary placesvComputer games. 0aImaginary wars and battlesvComputer games. 0aWeaponsvComputer games. 0aShootingvComputer games. 0aNintendo Switch video games. 7aVideo games.2olacvggt 7aaction video games.2olacvggt 7aPuzzles and games.2lcgft 7aAdventure video games.2olacvggt2 aUbisoft (Firm),epublisher.  aNintendo Switch  a.b12454205b09-02-22c06-17-22  cVGAME06  advgcme-fenggcauh0i0  g1i31939003677749j8224ldvg  o-p$65.00q-r-s-  t56u5v1w2x3y.i12174154z08-03-22  c35543d35543  00102ddc406VG_SW_RAB708VGSWI940084aAFPLbAFPLcVGSd2022-08-03ii12174154k2024-04-27 23:59:00l6m1n1oVG SW RAB  p31939003677749q2024-04-27r2024-04-13 11:12:07s2024-04-13v65.00w2023-11-11yVGAME
