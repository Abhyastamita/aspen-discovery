Themed after the classic novel Journey to the West, this party game has up to four players competing to come out on top. While Tang priest Xuanzang has collected the scriptures Buddha asked him to seek out, when the rabbids appear they accidentally scatter the texts again and the journey has to start all over. Luckily, the rabbids are willing to go seek them out. The large number of minigames has players doing anything from riding rockets to speed eating hot chilies, and players have to master their very different gameplay to beat their friends. Aside from the traditional multiplayer mode, an adventure mode lets players follow the game's story."--Mobygames.com 0aPlumbersvComputer games. 0aRabbids (Fictitious characters)vComputer games. 0aBrothersvComputer games. 0aImaginary placesvComputer games. 0aImaginary wars and battlesvComputer games. 0aWeaponsvComputer games. 0aShootingvComputer games. 7aPlaystation 4 video games.2olacvggt 7aAction video games.2olacvggt 7aPuzzles and games.2lcgft 7aAdventure video games.2olacvggt2 aUbisoft (Firm),epublisher.  aSony PlayStation 4  a.b12454199b08-03-22c06-17-22  cVGAME00  advgcme-fenggcauh0i0  g1i31939003677723j8224ldvg  o-p$65.00q-r-s-  t56u0v0w0x0y.i12174142z08-03-22  c35542d35542  00102ddc406VG_PS4_RAB708VGPS4940083aAFPLbAFPLcVGSd2022-08-03ii12174142l0oVG PS4 RAB  p31939003677723r2023-11-11 00:00:00v65.00w2023-11-11yVGAME
