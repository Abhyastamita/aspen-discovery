As Happy-Go-Lucky opens, he is learning to shoot guns with his sister, visiting muddy flea markets in Serbia, buying gummy worms to feed to ants, and telling his nonagenarian father wheelchair jokes. But then the pandemic hits, and like so many others, he's stuck in lockdown, unable to tour and read for audiences, the part of his work he loves most. To cope, he walks for miles through a nearly deserted city, smelling only his own breath. He vacuums his apartment twice a day, fails to hoard anything, and contemplates how sex workers and acupuncturists might be getting by during quarantine. As the world gradually settles into a new reality, Sedaris too finds himself changed. His offer to fix a stranger's teeth rebuffed, he straightens his own, and ventures into the world with new confidence. Newly orphaned, he considers what it means, in his seventh decade, no longer to be someone's son. And back on the road, he discovers a battle-scarred America: people weary, storefronts empty or festooned with Help Wanted signs, walls painted with graffiti reflecting the contradictory messages of our time: EAT THE RICH. TRUMP 2024. BLACK LIVES MATTER. Sedaris once again captures what is most unexpected, hilarious, and poignant about these recent upheavals, personal and public, and expresses in precise language both the misanthropy and desire for connection that drive us all. If we must live in interesting times, there is no one better to chronicle them than the incomparable David Sedaris"--cprovided by publisher.  aPlayaway Digital Audio.  aPLAYAWAY  a39 60 100 12910aSedaris, DavidvAnecdotes. 0aEssayistszUnited StatesvAnecdotes. 0aAmerican wit and humor. 7aPlayaway (Preloaded audio player)2lcgft 7aEssays.2lcgft 7aHumor.2lcgft 7aPersonal narratives.2lcgft 7aAnecdotes.2lcgft 7aAudiobooks.2lcgft 7aSound recordings.2lcgft12aSedaris, DavidtActive shooter.12aSedaris, DavidtFather time.12aSedaris, DavidtBruised.12aSedaris, DavidtSpeech to the graduates.12aSedaris, DavidtHurricane season.12aSedaris, DavidtHighfalutin.12aSedaris, DavidtUnbuttoned.12aSedaris, DavidtThemes and variations.12aSedaris, DavidtTo Serbia with love.12aSedaris, DavidtVacuum.2 aPlayaway Digital Audio.2 aFindaway World, LLC.  aa3098214  aMARCIVE0922  aBDD/LAS/20220818  aZ0bJOZ  aDIGITAL BOOK 814.54 SEDwDEWEYc1i31311006028702d1/16/2024e1/16/2024lSTACKSmHWSn7p$65.00rYsYtPRELOD_AUDu7/20/2022xAUDIOzADULT0NONFICTION  aDIGITAL BOOK 814.54 SEDwDEWEYc1i31139005894414d7/12/2023e6/30/2023lSTACKSmPFSn5p$49.00rYsYtPRELOD_AUDu7/20/2022xAUDIOzADULT0NONFICTION  aPLWY 818.54 SEDwDEWEYc1i31531005183881d3/2/2023e2/22/2023lAV_ADULTmBDDn9p$48.74rYsYtPRELOD_AUDu8/9/2022xAUDIOzADULT0NONFICTION  aPLAYAWAY 814.54 SEDwDEWEYMIXEDc1i31338007209940lAUDIOBK_A2mADDp$48.74rYsYtAUDIOBKu8/4/2022xAUDIOzADULT0NONFICTION2AU_PLAWAY
