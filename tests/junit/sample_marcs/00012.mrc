Themed after the classic novel Journey to the West, this party game has up to four players competing to come out on top. While Tang priest Xuanzang has collected the scriptures Buddha asked him to seek out, when the rabbids appear they accidentally scatter the texts again and the journey has to start all over. Luckily, the rabbids are willing to go seek them out. The large number of minigames has players doing anything from riding rockets to speed eating hot chilies, and players have to master their very different gameplay to beat their friends. Aside from the traditional multiplayer mode, an adventure mode lets players follow the game's story."--Mobygames.com 0aPlumbersvComputer games. 0aRabbids (Fictitious characters)vComputer games. 0aBrothersvComputer games. 0aImaginary placesvComputer games. 0aImaginary wars and battlesvComputer games. 0aWeaponsvComputer games. 0aShootingvComputer games. 7aXbox One video games.2olacvggt 7aAction video games.2olacvggt 7aPuzzles and games.2lcgft 7aAdventure video games.2olacvggt2 aUbisoft (Firm),epublisher.  aXbox One  a.b12454217b08-03-22c06-17-22  cVGAME00  advgcme-fenggcauh0i0  g1i31939003677731j8224ldvg  o-p$65.00q-r-s-  t56u0v0w0x0y.i12174166z08-03-22  c35544d35544  00102ddc406VG_XB1_RAB708VGXBX940085aAFPLbAFPLcVGSd2022-08-03ii12174166l0oVG XB1 RAB  p31939003677731r2023-11-11 00:00:00v65.00w2023-11-11yVGAME
